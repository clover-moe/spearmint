**Lilium Arena** is an engine and game-logic compatible with Quake III Arena 1.32.

The goal is to maintain the original Quake 3 gameplay, visuals, and audio experience while also providing a reliable code base for derivative projects and support for many platforms.


## About

Lilium Arena is the base project for various Quake 3 projects maintained under Clover.moe, such as Spearmint. It is based on the Quake 3 GPL source code by id Software that was further developed in ioquake3.

zturtleman contributed to ioquake3 from 2010 to 2025. Lilium Arena is a continuation of his vision for a Quake 3 1.32 engine with unfettered control of the project direction. Changes from ioquake3 may be selectively integrated.

Lilium Arena was established in 2021 with the intention of providing releases of a lightly modified ioquake3 to better match zturtleman's vision and to be the base for Lilium Arena Classic. In October 2025, zturtleman moved his primary development for Quake 3 1.32 to Lilium Arena and made it the base for all Quake 3 projects under Clover.moe.


## License

Lilium Arena is licensed under [the GNU GPLv2](COPYING.txt) (or at your option, any later version). The Quake 3 data files are not under a free license and must be purchased in order to play Quake 3.

## Compiling

Lilium Arena is compiled using GNU Make (`make`) and requires a C compiler. Most dependencies are included in the repository. Compiling for Linux requires installing SDL 2 library and headers.


## Contributing

High quality code contributions are more helpful than rushed contributions.

Reviewing pull requests is sometimes more work than a reviewer doing the work in the first place so pull requests may be disregarded.
